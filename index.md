## Main

Main content. Note that after each commit, GitHub runs [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages of this site.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. 

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rigt/try_git/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
